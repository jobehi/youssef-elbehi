Quite a curious title to inaugurate a personal blog, isn’t it? After all, I aim to fill these virtual pages with ideas that intrigue and inspire, so why start off by calling myself “a bored man”? Because boredom, as unglamorous as it sounds, is that tiny spark that ignites the creative blaze. And right now, dear reader, I am quite bored. So buckle up, for this restlessness is your first invitation to embark with me on a voyage of discovery, reflection, and delight.

## Do not bury your pain yet
ears ago, I watched a [Vsauce video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqKdEhx-dD4) on a fascinating psychological experiment. Participants were asked to sit quietly in a room for half an hour, no phone, no book, nothing at all except their own thoughts. Many found this nearly unbearable, they even had the option to administer a mild electric shock to themselves, and a startling number of them preferred that jolt of pain over facing unbroken mental solitude.

This experiment finds its root in this scientific paper: [Just think: The challenges of the disengaged mind](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4330241/).

I’m not aiming to wax philosophical about the nature of boredom, but I will say this: I did not feel bored for a long long time, and I know exactly why. The answers is on my pocket, literally. It is my smartphone. I have been using it as a crutch to avoid boredom, and I am not alone in this. In this era of doomscrolling, I have forgotten the importance of being bored, of letting my mind feel the pain of emptiness and silence. I am never bored, and my distractions from it are some cheap fast food dopamine hits that renders my will to create difficult and cumbersome.

Feeling guilty for not working on that novel you’ve been dreaming about? It’s easier to binge a random show on Netflix. Let the episodes flow, and watch your soul being from that guilty feeling for at least 4 weekends.

## Let's go on low-quality-cheap-dopamine fast

Now I could be hard on myself and start self loathing, And yet, I’ve proven that I am capable of doing things:  I’ve scripted films, poured my heart into writing, and tackled challenging projects loaded with failure and doubt. None of those endeavors were easy and that’s precisely why they mattered. In the end, each line I typed or scene I filmed felt immortal in its own small way, leaving indelible imprints on my psyche and maybe even on those around me. I can’t say the same for all the cat memes I’ve scrolled past over the years.

I create because something in me demands it. I create to vent anger, to question, to express something that runs deeper than words. Deep down, it’s a strange and precious attempt at immortality.

That need never faded away, but it was buried under the weight of the distractions I chose to indulge in. The detox was tough but necessary, and now it’s over.

**I am bored, and I am proud of it.**


Oh, and on a side note: welcome to my blog. I’ll be sharing random slices of life, thoughts, creations, and failures. I hope you enjoy the ride as much as I expect to. Let’s see where this journey takes us.
